  <h1> Stage 0: Getting Started with HTML</h1>
</div>
  <div class="subtext">
         <h3> The Path to the Internet </h3>
          <p> We interact with the internet through our computer and browser. The browser is a program that displays files on the web, intepreting them to show us what we see. The internet is essentially the world's largest computer, pulling files from servers though HTTP from the servers. Servers are essentially large computers that hold the files that make up the internet and sends them though the internet to our computers.  </p> 
  </div>
      <div class="subtext">
          <h3>A Basic Understanding of HTML's place in the Internet </h3>
            <p> The Web is made up of mainly HTML documents. 
            HTML stands for hypertext markup language and works essentially as the glue for everything else on the internet.
            There are five types of files on the web: <em> plain text, HTML, images, videos, and music </em>. HTML allows for hyperlinks, making the web "web-like".
            </p>
      </div>
      <div class="subtext">
          <h3>What makes up HTML?</h3>
            <p> HTML is made up of four elements. What you see is referred to as the text content. How the text content is displayed to you is the mark up. Links to other pages or reference to other documents like images and videos are how it helps the internet. 

            This is well-explained <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721/l-3508959201/m-48724340"> here </a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              A HTML markup is made up of the name of the tag, the content of the tag, and the end of the tag. This is explained in this <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721/l-3508959201/m-48723444"> video. </a> </p> 
  </div>
      <div class="subtext">

          <h3> Inline Tags</h3>
              <p> There are two types of tags: <em> inline</em> and <em> block</em>.
                  </p>
              <p>

              Inline tags are just tags that affect the text while block tags group together text that can be altered together, essentially putting them into boxes with height and width. <br>
              Common inline tags change the text so you can put them into italics and bold. How to use the bold tag is in this <a href= "https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721/l-3508959201/e-48011976/m-48703273"> video.</a>. How to use the italics tag is in this <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721/l-3508959201/e-48296546/m-48693677"> video </a>
             . 
              <br> 
              Another commonly used inline tag is attributes. This is how I linked all of the videos in this site. You can learn how to make them in this  <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721/l-3508959201/e-48508417/m-48723411"> video </a>
            .
            <br>
            Having images is just as simple with a little change. Image tags, like the break tag (used to add breaks in the text n the white space on the page) are void tags, meaning they don't need a closing tag.
            Adding images is shown <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721/l-3508959201/m-48744041"> here</a>
            . The concept of white space would be hard to explain on this limited text so just watch <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721/l-3508959201/e-48666064/m-48678767"> this </a>.  
            .

              </p> 
<h3> Block Tags</h3>
<p> Block tags have already been mentioned as different from inline tags. One commonly used block tag is the paragraph tag. This is used to group together text into a block. All of the text under a section heading, before another section heading here has been placed into a paragraph tag.  If you are still confused by the difference, watch <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721/l-3508959201/m-4872343"> this</a>

       <h3> Computers are stupid.</h3>
          <p> One that should not be forgotten is that the computer is stupid. Only the correct syntax will be understood properly by the computer. And do not feel stupid if you do not remember how to do something in HTML. That's what google is for. </p>

    <h3>Creating a Structured Document with HTML</h3>
      <p>A webpage is made up like a house. HTML is like the walls of the house.
        CSS controls how the house looks, like the color of the walls. Javascript shapes how 
        one interacts with the house, like a garage opener.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="subtext">
      <h3>Exploring the Web</h3>
        <p>Not all elements of the web is visible but all that is visible is in a rectangle. 
          Even other shapes are in a box, making rearranging web interfaces a lot simplier.
        </p>
        <p>A HTML document can be broken down into a tree-like structure. This tree-like structures also means that HTML elements can have other elements inside of them. This structure would show up in a series of nested boxes. 
          This is explained in this <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721-nd/l-3555039510/e-2771378561/m-2771378562"> video.</a>

          <li> <b>HTML</b>: standard mark up language used to create webpages </li>
          <li> <b>CSS</b> (Cascading Style Sheets): style sheet language used for describing look and formatting of document written in mark-up language/li>
          <li> <b>DOM</b> (Document Object Model): a cross platform and language-independent convention for representing and interacting with object in HTML and other makeup language, nodes in the document organized in tree structure is DOM tree</li>

      Adding CSS Style to HTML Structure
    </h2>
      <h3>
        What is CSS?
      </h3>
         <p>
           CSS is the decoration of the walls, displaying the HTML in the way desired. It is applied as the law of the website with a concept called <span class="em"> inheritance </span>. What this means is that properties are applied to a specificed element as well as any continuing ones, essentially the entire page. CSS is a great way to avoid repetition so programmers don't have to write the same code over and over. It also avoids problems that can arise from repeated code since every code needs to be adjusted. Using CSS will just change everything in one go.  
         </p>
       <h3>
           How does CSS control HTML? 
      </h3>
        <p>
          With a selection, declaration, value and property. The section could be a heading tag or div class tag. This concept has been explained in this <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721-nd/l-3575138706/e-2663568566/m-2616578593"> video. </a>
      </p>
    
       There are three methods of adding CSS Styling to a Webpage:
        <ul>
          <li>Method 1: Writing CSS in the head tag of your HTML</li>
          <li>Method 2: Link your HTML to separate CSS file</li>
          <li> Method 3: Write your style inline with your HTML</li>
        </ul>

     
    </div>
    <div class="subtext">
      <h2>
        Using Semantic Tags
      </h2>
      <p> 
            Browsers use default stylesheets to determine how to display the HTML elements. There is a need to standardize it. This is explained better in this <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721-nd/l-3575138706/e-2811608545/m-2810478547"> video. </a> Using a prefix in your CSS code can also modify the code for different browsers.

      <h2> 
        The Box Revisited: Vocabulary List
      </h2>
    
         <ul>
          <li> Content: This box deals with how the text is displayed.</li>
          <li>Padding: This box deals with everything around the content, including the background.</li>
          <li> Margin: The box is the space between boxes.</li>
        </ul>

        This is well explained in this <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721-nd/l-3575138706/e-2771378569/m-2792478544">

          <h2> Adjusting Boxes 
          </h2>
          <p>
            By setting the size of the boxes to percentages, the page will adjust for changing window size. 
          </p>
          <h3> Box Sizing </h3>
        
            <ul>
          <li> 1. HTML elements are just boxes with each box made up of 4 components..</li>
          <li> 2. It is often hard to get the size of the box just right because of the variety of components in each box. </li>
          <li> 3. There are two techniques as to how you can deal with sizing issues: setting sizes to percentages (as mentioned earlier) and setting box=sizing attibute to border-box for each element. </li>
          <li> 4. Different browsers work slightly different. This causes different dispays from the same code. </li>
        </ul>

          
      </div>
      <div class="subtext">
      <h2> Box Positioning </h2>
        <p>
          Using the div tag as a block element makes it difficult since it takes up the entire width of the page. Adding a rule display:flex to the appropriate CSS can override this issue. </p>
      </div>
      
    <div class="subtext">
      <h2> Adding image </h2>
      
         <ul>
          <li>1. Make a folder and put your image in it.</li>
          <li>2. Add to HTML with the img tag.</li>
          <li> 3. Always use alternative wording in case the image doesn't show up. </li>
      </ul>

      <h2> Review </h2>
        -Remember to box up everything you see and size those boxes. 
       <ul>
          <li> 1. Look for natural boxes.</li>
          <li>2. Look for repeated sytles and semantic elements. </li>
          <li> 3. Write the HTML. </li>
         <li> 4. Apply styles from biggest to smallest.</li>
         <li> 5. Fix things. </li>
         <li> 6. Repeat 3 and 4 until it works in multiple browsers and looks the desired way.</li>

    <h3> Telling Computers What to Do </h3>
    <p>
      A computer is basically an machine that can be programmed. By program, the computer program is sequence. The python interpreter only understand python code. 
    </br>
      The grammar of python can be broken down though Backus-Naur Form. It can be essentially broken into non-terminals to replacements. By deriving the non-terminals though replacements, you only end up with terminals left. It's akin to a sentence (as the non-terminal) being broken down to subject, verb. object (terminals). The usefulness of python is the functions allow for commands that will avoid repeition. By having a command that will output something that would otherwise be very time consuming to rewrite over and over, a programmer can save a lot of time. 
   
    </p>

  <div class="subtext">
    <h3>
      Introduction to Serious Programming
    </h3>
    <p>
      The Python Grammer can be broken down to arthimetic expressions. It is called replacement grammer, describing large language with small set of rules. By breaking down the statement "Expression Operator Expressions", you can replace each expression and operator with a number and command. It is described in this <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer/#!/c-nd000/l-4180729266/m-48738047"> video. </a> You may use variables to assign value to (as a shortcut to writing it). 
</div>
  <div class="subtext">
    <h3>Python Basics</h3>
    <p>
      To start a string, you start and end with a ". It works the same with a '. The string for python in this simple one character string template: &lt string &gt [ &lt expression &gt]. If you wanted a string that is the subsequence of the character in s, starting from position start and ending, use this one: &lt string &gt [&lt expression &gt : &lt expression &gt]. If you wanted to use """, """, that is used for mult-line strings. 
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to find a string in strings, you use the template: &ltstring&gt.find(&lt string &gt). If you are seeking the substring in a string (shared as a varaible) is the same as a string: "text"=.find("t"). And if there are two parameters: "text".find("t".l). l tells where to start looking. Using negative indexing is useful to cover any text placed between the div as oppsose to exactly the right length so that it can adjust when needed. 
    </p>

  <h3>
    HTML div elements
  </h3>
  <p>
    <ul>
          <li> 1. First line should be the opening tag: &lt div &gt</li>
          <li>2. The 2nd line should be the text within the div (don't forget to indent) </li>
          <li> 3. Closing tag </li>
        </ul>  
  </p>
</div>
<div class="subtext">
  <h3>
    Using Procedure
  </h3>
  <p>
    Functions encapsulate tasks, combining many instructions into a single line of code. It allows us to conceive programs as a bunch of sub-steps (with each substep as its own function). Functions also keep the variable namespace clean as only local variables live as the function does. 
    <br>
     They can be made in Python by starting the line of the code with the keyword 'def' and then giving the function name, combined with function parameters.  &lt procedure &gt (&lt input &gt, &lt input &gt,..) would be the procedure template. In order to use the function, you have to write the name of the function, followed by values we want to give in the parenthese. The input is the operands and arguments. It's a different way to command. Once you define a function, you don't have to do it again; this allows the reusing of code instead of rewriting it. If you don't put in a 'return' keyword, Python will present a NONE as the output. This template can allowed you to this: find('au',3). Using print statements to doublecheck code is called debugging. 
  </p>
</div>
 <div class="subtext">
  <h3>
    While loops, if and else functions
  </h3>
  <p>
    When making decisions, you can use &lt and &gt, giving the Boolean values. The if statement allows for the situation to be true, the function wil procceed. The template is 
    <br>
    if &lt text expression &gt:
    <br>
    &lt block &gt
    <br>
    return
    <br> To use these, just define the expression and give it restrictions that need to be completed in order for the expression to run. The indents, not displayed here, are important. If the 1st expression is true, the second expression would not be evaluated. You can use "or" to add in different instructions. 
  </p>
</div>
 <div class="subtext">
  <h3>
    Loops
  </h3>
  <p>
   A loop allows for the computer to output something over and over until the restriction is met. The template looks like this:
  <br>
    While &lt text expression &gt
    <br>
    &lt block &gt
    <br>
    return
    <br>

    Debugging Strategy Recap
  </h3>
  <p>
   <ul>
          <li> Examine error messages when programs crash.
	-reading backwords from the last line of the python tracebacks can tell you what went wrong.</li>
<li>2. Work from example code.
	  -if your modified code doesn’t work, comment it out and do step-by-step modifications to the examples code until it does what you want.</li>
<li>3. Make sure examples work.
	-Just because you find example code doesn’t mean it will work in your system. Check the example code you’re using to make sure it behaves the way you expect.

  <h3>
    Structured Data: Lists & For Loops
  </h3>
  <p>
   For a loop, iterate over structured data. A string is a sequence of characters. A list is a sequence of anything. A nested list allows for lists to present the desired information from the list. Check out this <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer/#!/c-nd000/l-4152219158/m-48683665"> video. </a>

  <h3>
    Mutations 
  </h3>
  <p>
   Lists can support mutation, changing the lists after we make it.  This allows the assignment of the same 2 variables as the same.  This is shown here: <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer/#!/c-nd000/l-4152219158/m-48713505"> Click here. </a> One of the ways to do it is though the ‘append’ command. This can be placed out like this comment: <br>
    &lt list &gt.append(&lt element &gt)
    <br>
    This will allow the element to be added to the list. You can also add lists together using the + operation. You can also use the “for” command to create loops on lists. 
    Shown <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer/#!/c-nd000/l-4152219158/m-48204891"> here. </a>You can have loops to go through lists of strings. An example are shown in this <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer/#!/c-nd000/l-4152219158/e-48753039/m-48736103"> section </a>. The index method is 
&lt list &gt.index(&lt value &gt) when almost solving finding the index but can’t give not finding it. If &lt value &gt is in the &lt list &gt , it returns the 1st position where &lt value &gt is found in &lt list &gt. Otherwise, it will produce an error.
